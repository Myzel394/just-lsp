## Features

The server implements a decent amount of the
language server protocol [specifiction](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/).
This section aims to document some of them.

### `textDocument/completion`

Completions are provided to you as you type. We currently show recipes, built-in
functions, and constants.

### `textDocument/definition`

You're able to go to a recipe definition from an identifier.

### `textDocument/hover`

You can request hover information for recipes, built-in functions, constants
and see information about them.

### `textDocument/publishDiagnostics`

We try to publish useful diagnostics. Some of them include checks for non-existent
aliases, dependencies, and syntax errors.

### `textDocument/references`

All references to an identifier can be shown. This includes aliases,
dependencies, and recipes.

### `textDocument/rename`

Workspace-wide symbol renaming is supported.
